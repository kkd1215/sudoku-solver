# Sudoku-Solver

This is a sudoku solver using the backtracking algorithm.It includes a graphical interface which is made with the help of pygame.

# Description

This problem is first solved on a text based version.
A GUI version of the problem is made with the help of [pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/)

## Libraries used

    - Time
    - Pygame

## Algorithm used :
*Backtracking* is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.

you can check it out on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking)

# Instructions :

Click a box and hit the number on your keybaord to temporarily put in a number. To confirm that value press the ENTER key on that box. To delete the temporary number you can click DEL. Finally to solve the board press S.

## Future plans :

To create a Generator for sudoku which randomly generates a whole sudoku board with random numbers along side the rules of sudoku.
Then solves the board and selects the output with only 1 possible solution.
This output is then taken and randomly some numbers are removed (can set different dificulties with this).
Finally this list is given as an input to this solver.


**Have fun playing with it!!!**
